# ConrolFanByUsingGUI-TempSensor
By using the desktop app, using the C language, you can control the operation of the fan and increase its speed when the temperature increases
The aim of this project is to design a temperature controlled fan using microcontroller,
in which the fan is automatically turned ON or OFF according to the temperature. 
The LM35 temperature sensor will give continuous analog output corresponding to the temperature sensed by it.
This analog signal is given to the ADC, which converts the analog values to digital values.
In order to get the temperature from the sensed analog voltage, we need to perform some calculations in the programming for the microcontroller.
Once the calculations are done by the microcontroller according to the logic, the temperature is displayed on the GUI.
The microcontroller will continuously monitor the temperature.
If the temperature exceeds more than 50 deg Celsius (as per the code), the microcontroller will turn on the relay to start the fan.
If the temperature drops below 40 deg Celsius (as per the code).
